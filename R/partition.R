DOC <- "
Usage: 
  partition [-h -c CUT -s SEP <DIST>]

This is only an example of using R functions in pipes. Simple partitioning by cutting complete (\'maximum\') hierarchical clustering. Input <DIST> should be a square distance matrix.

Options:
  -h, --help  Showing this help text
  -c CUT      Height of cutting the tree, in fraction of maximum [default: 0.99]
  -s SEP      Column separator [default: \t]
